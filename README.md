# Support-Vector-Machines
In this mini-project, we used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on a custom binary classification dataset.
We trained linear, tuned and RBF kernel SVMs and visualized the decision boundaries in 2D using two selected features. We also tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to improve accuracy. This project demonstrates how kernel choice and tuning impact model performance.
